# Snowcast-Showdon
A Driven Data competition attempt, hosted by the bureau of Reclamation U.S. 

## Getting Started

For this challenge we are going to estimate snow water equivalent (SWE) at a high spatiotemporal resolution over the Western U.S. for the years 2020-2021 using near real-time data sources.

This project contains 4 files: eda_preprocessing, null_imputation, sarimax_forecast, spacial_interpolation

## Dataset

The available data are about 91K measurements for a wide range of spatial grid cells to be used in the years 2013-2019. Some of these sources include complete data for 700 snow monitoring stations (SNOTEL/CDEC) located away from the prediction cells.

Additional gathered data 

## Installation
